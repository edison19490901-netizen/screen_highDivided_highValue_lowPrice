# Dashboard of High Dividend Screen

A-share all-market high-dividend low-valuation stock screening dashboard.  
Filters **market cap > 500B CNY**, **dividend yield > 3%**, **price within 15% of 1-year low**, and **price within 15% of weekly BB lower band** from ~5,500 listed stocks, with Bollinger Bands and buy-weight scoring.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your Tushare token
echo TUSHARE_TOKEN=your_token > .env

# Start the API server
python app.py

# Open dashboard.html in browser

## Data Pipeline

| Step | Source | Data |
|---|---|---|
| Market cap + dividend yield | Tushare `daily_basic` (cached as parquet) | ~5,500 stocks |
| Filter | JS in dashboard | mcap > 500B, yield > 3%, pct_from_low < 15%, pct_from_lower < 15% |
| Latest price + 1Y low + BB | Baostock | OHLC daily → weekly BB(20,2) |
| Buy weight | JS formula | See below |

**Dividend yield recalculation**: DPS (dividend per share) is derived from Tushare `dv_ttm` and treated as a stable value (companies change dividends at most 1-2×/year). Each time Baostock refreshes the latest price, `dividend_yield = DPS / latest_price × 100` is recalculated automatically. This ensures the displayed yield always reflects the current market price, not stale Tushare data.

## Buy Weight Formula

```
Buy Weight = 0.4 × LowScore + 0.4 × DivScore + 0.2 × BBScore

LowScore  = max(0, 50 − pctFromLow) / 45
DivScore  = (dividendYield − 3) / (maxYield − 3)
BBScore   = max(0, 30 − pctFromBBLower) / 30
```

## Dashboard Columns

| # | Column | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Stock name + code | Tushare |
| 2 | Market cap (B CNY) | Tushare |
| 3 | Latest price | Baostock |
| 4 | 1-year low | Baostock |
| 5 | % from low | Calculated |
| 6 | Dividend yield (TTM) | Tushare DPS ÷ Baostock daily price |
| 7 | Dividend per share (DPS) | Tushare (stable, recalculated weekly) |
| 8 | BB lower band (weekly) | Baostock → calculated |
| 9 | % from BB lower | Calculated |
| 10 | Buy weight (0–100) | Formula |
